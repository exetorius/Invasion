# Invasion

A strategic base management and tactical combat game built in **Unreal Engine 5** using **C++**.

You command a sovereign national base in a world under alien threat. Recruit and manage personnel, research technologies, engineer equipment, and deploy squads to defend against escalating incursions.

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Engine** | Unreal Engine 5 |
| **Language** | C++ (with Blueprint for UI) |
| **Multiplayer** | Optional, session-based via Steam (AdvancedSteamSessions) |
| **Solo** | First-class, complete experience |
| **Status** | Early development — Sprint 0 complete |

---

## Core Design Philosophy

**Solo play is a complete, first-class experience.** Multiplayer is opt-in and session-based — not a requirement.

In multiplayer, each player commands a **sovereign national base**. Players share a game world and face a common threat, but each base belongs entirely to its owner. Players start a campaign together; no hot-dropping mid-campaign. The world is host-owned and persistent via Steam sessions.

Difficulty scales with diminishing returns per additional player (100% / 130% / 155% / 175%) so multiplayer is pressure, not punishment.

## Architecture

The project uses a modular architecture with focused modules per system, designed for fast iteration and explicit dependencies.

```

### Key Patterns

- **GameInstance Subsystems** — primary pattern for all game systems
- **Per-player BaseManagerState** — replicated actor holding each player's base data
- **Event-driven UI** — tiles fire delegates upward, screens coordinate and call RPCs
- **Wrapped third-party plugins** — game code never calls AdvancedSteamSessions directly

---

## Base Management System

The first fully implemented system. Players hire, manage and deploy a roster of personnel across five roles:

| Role | Combat Skill | Work Efficiency |
|---|---|---|
| Soldier | High (50–90) | Moderate (40–75) |
| Scientist | Low (10–50) | High (60–95) |
| Engineer | Low (10–50) | High (60–95) |
| Medic | Moderate (30–60) | Moderate (40–75) |
| Pilot | Low (10–50) | Moderate (40–75) |

Workers have health, morale, injury severity, and status. Stats use float ranges to support future buff/debuff systems.

### Worker Replication

`UWorkerData` is a replicated `UObject`. Key implementation details:
- `bReplicateUsingRegisteredSubObjectList = true` on both `ABaseManagerState` and `ARegionalWorkerPool`
- Workers registered via `AddReplicatedSubObject()` in both the pool (while available) and the state (after hire)
- Subobject registration transfers on hire and fire — deregistered from source, registered on destination
- Server RPCs on pool actors must route through `AManagementPlayerController` — pool actors have no player owner connection

## Dev Notes

This project is built solo. Development follows a lightweight Agile process — 1-week sprints, Fibonacci story points, GitHub Issues for tracking.

Architecture decisions are documented in `/Docs/GDD/` and captured in `CLAUDE.md` for AI-assisted pair programming sessions.

Notable decisions logged so far:
- [Multiplayer Model: Sovereign Bases](/Docs/GDD/04_Multiplayer.md) — each player owns their base, solo is first-class
- Worker replication via `UObject` subobject list — avoids struct limitations while keeping data modular

## Roadmap (High Level)

- [x] Core module structure
- [x] Worker data model + replication
- [x] Per-player BaseManagerState
- [x] Regional worker pools
- [x] Hiring UI (single player + multiplayer)
- [x] Fire workers (returns to pool, multiplayer tested)
- [ ] Hiring UI polish (stats, cost, credits validation)
- [ ] Nation selection screen
- [ ] Save system
- [ ] Research system
- [ ] Engineering system
- [ ] Tactical combat (long term)

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Right-click `Invasion.uproject` → **Generate Visual Studio / Rider project files**
3. Build in your IDE
4. Open in Unreal Engine 5

> Requires **AdvancedSteamSessions** plugin. Steam must be running for multiplayer sessions.
